## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing it repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix
## The following functions perform: 
# 1. set the value of the matrix
# 2. get the value of the matrix
# 3. set the value of inverse of the matrix
# 4. get the value of inverse of the matrix

## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  invrs <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    invrs <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) invrs <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() invrs
  list(set=set, get=get, setinverse=setinverse, getinverse=getinverse)
}

## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...){
  invrs <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(invrs)) {
    message("getting cached data.")
    return(invrs)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  invrs <- solve(data)
  x$setinverse(invrs)
  invrs
}
